## MARKS AND CHANNELS

## Expressiveness and Effectiveness

```{r}
library(faraway)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(fruitfly, aes(x = longevity, y = activity)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + coord_flip()  +
  labs(title = "Longevity of Fruitflies Depending on Sexual Activity")
```

# Figure 1

The fruitfly data frame in the faraway package is from a study of the effect of sexual activity on the longevity of male fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster).3 Male fruit flies were randomly assigned to one of five treatment groups for sexual activity (activity). Each male fruit fly was individually kept with zero, one, or eight inseminated or virgin female fruit flies. The treatment conditions with inseminated females serve as control conditions for the treatment condition with the same number of females because pregnant fruit flies will not mate. And these might be better control conditions than that with no access to females since the presence of other fruit flies might have other effects such as competition for food. The dot plot in figure 1 shows the distribution of longevity of the male fruit flies in each treatment group. The marks included are points and shapes, and the channels included are length and the distriubtion of the data points.

```{r}
library(faraway)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(fruitfly, aes(x = longevity, y = activity)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + coord_flip()  +
geom_point(position = position_jitter(width = 0.5)) + 
  labs(title = "Longevity of Fruitflies Depending on Sexual Activity")
```

# Figure 2

I added in jitter plots over the existing boxplot to disrupt the expressiveness of the visualization's channels. Instead of expressing just the information in the dataset attributes, it now shows un-ordered data and creates an unclear and confusion visual description of the data.

## Discriminability

```{r}
#| warning: false
library(trtools)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(cortex, aes(x = group, y = weight)) + 
  facet_wrap(~ experiment, ncol = 5) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge", aes(fill=group)) +
  xlab("Treatment Group") +
  ylab("Cortex Weight (mg)") +
  ggtitle("Effects of Experience on Brain Development", subtitle = "Experiments:") +
  theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 380, hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.5, size = 10),
        legend.position = "right")
```

# Figure 3

The data in figure 3 is from a study that investigated the impact of experience on brain development in rats. Two young rats from each litter were each randomly assigned to a treatment condition in which the rat lived in an enriched environment with other rats and toys that were regularly changed, or a control condition where the rat lived in isolation without any toys. Later the weights of the cortex of each rat was measured. This was done in five separate experiments. The plot ib figure 3 shows that data. There is not much information about what differentiates the experiments, but from the plot it appears clear that there are some differences in cortex weight across experiments. This may be due to differences in the rats used. The marks used are lines and the channels used are the length of the box and the color of the box.

```{r}
library(trtools)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(cortex, aes(x = litter, y = weight)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge", aes(fill=group)) +
  xlab("Treatment Group") +
  ylab("Cortex Weight (mg)") +
  ggtitle("Effects of Experience on Brain Development", subtitle = "Experiments:") +
  theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 360, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5, size = 10),
        legend.position = "right")
```

# Figure 4

In terms of marks I used lines. The red and blue colors represent if the rat belonged to either the control group or the treatment (meaning the rat had playmates and toys). The multiple bars are determined by which litter the rat came from and the use of including the specific litters that each observation came from creates way too many bins and causes the graph to look even more cluttered than it did in Figure 3.

## Separability

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
library(trtools)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
biomass |> group_by(treatment) |>
summarize(total = mean(total), suitable = mean(suitable))
p <- ggplot(biomass, aes(x = total, y = suitable, color = treatment)) +
geom_point() + theme_minimal() +
labs(x = "Total Biomass (kg/ha)",
y = "Suitable Biomass (kg/ha)",
color = "Treatment")
plot(p)
```

# Figure 5

Figure 5 comes from a study that investigated the impact of fuel reduction timber harvests for fire risk management on forage resources for deer. The data include several types of biomass of 106 plots, each with an area of 0.5 hectares (ha). Some of the plots were “treated” with a fuel reduction, and some were not. Consider the difference in total and suitable biomass between treated and untreated plots. Suitable biomass refers to that of plants that are most nutritious to deer. Figure 5 shows the amount of suitable biomass for each plot, as well as the total biomass and the treatment. The marks used for this figure was points and the channels included were color and position (both horizontal and vertical) which represented if the plot recieved fire management treatment or not, and how much suitable biomass and total biomass the plot has.

```{r}
library(trtools)
library(dplyr)
biomass |> group_by(treatment) |>
summarize(total = mean(total), suitable = mean(suitable))
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(biomass, aes(x = total, y = suitable, color = treatment)) +
geom_point() + theme_minimal() +
    scale_color_manual(values = c("darkolivegreen2", "darkolivegreen3")) +
labs(x = "Total Biomass (kg/ha)",
y = "Suitable Biomass (kg/ha)",
color = "Treatment")
plot(p)
```

# Figure 6

In order to alter the Separability of the scatterplot in figure 2, I made both treatment colors similar shades of dark olive green as a way to hinder the different visual features (i.e., the difference between observations that fall into the yes or no treatment groups). By creating similar looking treatment group colors, it ensured that viewers cannot interpret the data correctly or separate out the different treatments of the study.

## Popout

```{r}
#| warning: false
library(asbio)
library(dplyr)
data(ant.dew)
ant.dew <- ant.dew |>
mutate(direction = case_when(
direction == "A" ~ "Descending",
direction == "D" ~ "Ascending",
.default = direction
))
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
p <- ggplot(ant.dew, aes(x = head.width, y = ant.mass, color = direction)) +
theme_minimal() + geom_point() +
labs(x = "Head Width (mm)", y = "Mass (mg)", color = "Direction") +
  geom_point(data = ant.dew, aes(x = 1.84, y = 10.00),
             color = "black", size = 3, shape = 8)
plot(p)
```

# Figure 7

The data for figure 7 is from a study of the harvesting of honeydew by red wood ants (Formica rufa). Measurements of ant mass and head width were taken for ants that were ascending trees on their way to harvest honeydew, and also for ants that were descending trees that were already laden with honeydew they were carrying back to their nest. For this study, I was interested in documenting any ants with head widths above 1.83 *AND* a mass of 10 mg or less since they could be at risk of having a morphological deformity when ascending up a tree. The marks I used were points and I denoted any ants with head widths above 1.83 *AND* a mass of 10 mg or less with a black star and green circle outline. For channels I included colors to differentiate the direction the ant was going in and also the position on the grid represents how large and heavy the ant is.

```{r}
library(asbio)
library(dplyr)
data(ant.dew)
ant.dew <- ant.dew |>
mutate(direction = case_when(
direction == "A" ~ "Descending",
direction == "D" ~ "Ascending",
.default = direction
))
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
p <- ggplot(ant.dew, aes(x = head.width, y = ant.mass, color = direction)) +
theme_minimal() + geom_point() +
labs(x = "Head Width (mm)", y = "Mass (mg)", color = "Direction") +
  geom_point(data = ant.dew, aes(x = 1.84, y = 10.00),
             shape = 1)
plot(p)
```

# Figure 8

The popout concept is shown in figure 8 by transforming the same data point from figure 7 into a red dot with a slightly blue ring around it demonstrating how hard it would be to distinguish it from the other red data points as opposed to using a different shape and color such as I did in figure 7.

*THE END*
